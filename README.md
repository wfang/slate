**Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale**


[TOC]

About
=====

SLATE will offer a modern replacement for ScaLAPACK.
ScaLAPACK is a numerical software library of dense linear algebra routines
essential to the field of scientific and engineering computing,
with good asymptotic scaling properties, but lack of support for modern node architectures,
which are based on multicore processors and hardware accelerators,
and characterized by complex memory hierarchies.
SLATE will allow for the development of multicore and accelerator capabilities,
by leveraging recent progress and ongoing efforts in mainstream programming models
(MPI3 and beyond, OpenMP4 and beyond, OpenACC, etc.), and runtime scheduling systems
(PaRSEC, Legion, etc.).
